# Saddle Point Visualization Project
## Overview

This project demonstrates how to visualize a saddle point using Python and Matplotlib. It consists of two key files:

    python-code-saddle-point.py: This file contains the Python code that generates a 3D plot of a saddle point using the function f(x,y)=3x^2âˆ’2y^2. It uses Matplotlib for graphing and NumPy for numerical calculations.

    explanation-graphing-saddle-point.md: This file explains each block of the code in python-code-saddle-point.py. It provides detailed commentary on how the 3D plot is generated, including the mathematical function, grid creation, and visualization process.

Usage

    Run python-code-saddle-point.py to generate a 3D plot of a saddle point.
    Refer to explanation-graphing-saddle-point.md for an in-depth breakdown of how the code works.

This project is useful for understanding how to graphically visualize critical points, specifically saddle points, in multivariable functions.
