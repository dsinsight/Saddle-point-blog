Let's break down each part of the code and explain its purpose:
1. Importing Libraries

python

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D

    //numpy (np): A powerful library for numerical computations, used for generating the grid of xx and yy values.
    matplotlib.pyplot (plt): This is a plotting library in Python. It's used here to generate 2D and 3D visualizations.
    mpl_toolkits.mplot3d.Axes3D: A module required to plot 3D surfaces in Matplotlib.

2. Defining the Function

python

def f(x, y):
    return 3*x**2 - 2*y**2

    This defines the mathematical function f(x,y)=3x2−2y2.
    The function takes two arguments, x and y, and returns the calculated value z=3x2−2y2. This will be used to create the 3D surface.

3. Generating the Grid of Values for x and y

python

x = np.linspace(-2, 2, 400)
y = np.linspace(-2, 2, 400)
x, y = np.meshgrid(x, y)

    np.linspace(-2, 2, 400): This creates 400 evenly spaced values for x and y between -2 and 2. These values are needed to generate a smooth surface.
    np.meshgrid(x, y): This function creates a 2D grid of x and y values. The result is two 2D arrays where each point on the grid corresponds to a combination of x and y values. These grids are then used to calculate the corresponding z-values.

4. Calculating the Function Values for the Grid

python

z = f(x, y)

    This computes the function f(x,y) at every point on the 2D grid, producing a grid of z-values (heights) for the 3D plot.

5. Creating the 3D Plot

python

fig = plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')

    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8)): Creates a figure object with a specified size (10 units wide and 8 units tall).
    fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d'): Adds a 3D subplot to the figure, allowing us to plot a 3D surface. The argument 111 means that we are creating a plot in a single grid layout (1 row, 1 column, 1 plot).

6. Plotting the Surface

python

ax.plot_surface(x, y, z, cmap='coolwarm', edgecolor='none')

    ax.plot_surface(x, y, z): This function plots the 3D surface based on the x, y, and z values. It visualizes the function z=f(x,y) in 3D space.
    cmap='coolwarm': Specifies the color map used to shade the surface. Here, we use the 'coolwarm' colormap, where warm colors (like red) represent higher values, and cool colors (like blue) represent lower values.
    edgecolor='none': This removes the grid lines between points on the surface, giving the plot a smooth appearance.

7. Highlighting the Saddle Point

python

ax.scatter(0, 0, 0, color='r', s=100)

    ax.scatter(0, 0, 0): Plots a red dot at the saddle point (0,0,0) on the 3D surface to highlight the saddle point location.
    color='r': Specifies that the point should be red.
    s=100: Specifies the size of the point (100 units).

8. Labeling the Axes and Title

python

ax.set_xlabel('X')
ax.set_ylabel('Y')
ax.set_zlabel('Z')
ax.set_title('Saddle Point at (0, 0) for f(x, y) = 3x^2 - 2y^2')

    ax.set_xlabel('X'): Sets the label for the x-axis.
    ax.set_ylabel('Y'): Sets the label for the y-axis.
    ax.set_zlabel('Z'): Sets the label for the z-axis (the function value).
    ax.set_title(): Sets the title of the 3D plot, describing the function and the highlighted saddle point.

9. Displaying the Plot

python

plt.show()

    plt.show(): Displays the figure containing the 3D surface plot and the saddle point.

Summary of the Code's Workflow:

    Define the function f(x,y).
    Create grids of x and y values.
    Compute z=f(x,y) for the entire grid.
    Set up a 3D figure and add a surface plot of the function.
    Highlight the saddle point at (0,0,0).
    Label the axes and plot the figure.

This visualization helps us understand how a saddle point behaves by showing the concave and convex curvatures in different directions.
